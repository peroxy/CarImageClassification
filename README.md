# Car Image Classification
This project uses Tensorflow to create image classification models. The model learns by using data from avto.net that is stored in a local sqlite database (acquired using https://github.com/peroxy/AvtoNetScraper).

## Getting started
1. make sure you're on **Python 3.8.3 64-bit**, other versions have not been tested
2. rename **config.py.template** to **config.py** and change config parameters
3. restore packages from **requirements.txt** file
4. run **main.py**
