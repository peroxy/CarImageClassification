# Car Image Classification
This project uses Tensorflow to create image classification models. The model learns by using data from avto.net that is stored in a local sqlite database (acquired using https://github.com/peroxy/AvtoNetScraper).

## Getting started
1. Make sure you're on `Python 3.8.x 64-bit`, other versions have not been tested
2. Rename `config.py.template` to `config.py` and change config parameters
3. Restore packages from `requirements.txt` file
4. Run `__main.py__`
